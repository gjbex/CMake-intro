# HDF5 Fortran examples

A collection of code samples to illustrate reading and writing HDF5
files from Fortran.

## What is it?

1. `create_h5.f90`: creates an HDF5 file with a `particles` group at
   root-level that contains two data sets, `mass` and `position`,
   10 x 1, and 10 x 3 respectively, type single precision real number.
2. `compute_center_of_mass.f90`: computes the center of mass of the
   particles in the file, takes a file name as command line argument.
3. `test.h5`: sample HDF5 file
4. `append_h5.f90`: when first called, creates an HDF5 file with a single
   dataset that can be extended in one of its dimensions. and populates
   it with data.  On consecutive calls, it will each time extend the
   dataset, and add values to it.  Takes a HDF5 file name as argument.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
