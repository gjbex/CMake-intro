# MPI

MPI (Message Passing Interface) is the de-facto standard for distributed
scientific computing.  These a just a few example to give you a taste of the
programming style.


## What is it?

1. `compute_pi.f90`: program that computes pi by using the ration of the area
   of a circle versus that of a square.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the applications.
